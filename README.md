Heartbit is a simple GUI interface for quickly editing xml
configuration files for either Chimera or FARCOS detectors.

In order to run you need a resources directory, you can download it
from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2znJ2THUGDib2w1bmE2Yk0zSHM

Then unzip it in the same directory the heartbit code is.

The resources may improve over time so you might have to replace the
resources folder from time to time by downloading from the same link.
